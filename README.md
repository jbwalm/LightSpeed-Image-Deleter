# LightSpeed-Image-Deleter
This UiPath program navigates through a list of inventory items while deleting their images.

This is useful for a LightSpeed inventory manager who does not have access to the LightSpeed inventory database and needs to remove images from many items.

You can automate this process and continue other work.
