# LightSpeed-Image-Deleter
This UiPath program navigates through a list of inventory items while deleting their images.

This is useful for a LightSpeed inventory manager who does not have access to the LightSpeed inventory database and needs to remove images from many items.

You can automate this process and continue other work.

The images used are filler images from a test system. 

Remove all screenshots and replace them as required, although this should mostly not be required.
The only change required is the beginning go to url function.

This could also be extended further with Docker Cloud.
